So the code itself is made by github copilot with minimal oversight and editing(Essentially zero).

This purpose of this project is to scrape data from tcgplayer to get snapshots of individual listings.
This culminatino of all the individual snapshots will allow a user to build the shape and transformation of the market as a whole

This project is broken into two parts:

1. Link scraper
    This blanket searches every listing on tcgplayer in the sealed pokemon category and compiles a csv file with every link
2. Database populater
    This takes those links and logs hopefully every numerical datapoint available on each listing page

There are also other files as well that I let copilot make that I don't understand very well which still need to be reviewed.
