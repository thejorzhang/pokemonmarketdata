Goal 1: Get data

made a script to throw names and links into a db file (idk if these even works well but I did create my first db file so yay)
realized i would need the links
    created a link scraper but it didn't work i'm not sure why
    created a new script which uses selenium but on load the page brings up a white screen

work for next time is to make a link scraper that puts links into the products.csv file
after we can accomplish this I think we have figured out how to scrape tcgplayer data and can move to making the whole tcg scraper

after that we can use the data to create implement formulas such as a time Decay

Goal 2: Implement formulas

Goal 3: Transfer to an aesthetic visual

Goal 4: Publish somewhere
